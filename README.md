## About
On the website, you can count the length of your sentences.\
This repository is for my first website.\
I will make an effort to use English in this repository\
Even if there is any strange English, please don't mind.\
If you have any ideas to improve this website, please let me know!\
By the way, "RunningMan.png" was generated by [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-8sPlJ64Gn-tiyatutogpt).

## How to use 
Type your sentence into the gray textbox, and it will automatically count your characters.\
If you set your target character count, the running boy at the top will show you your progress.\
You can switch light/dark mode by pressing the toggle button.\
To delete your typed sentences, press the delete button.

## Future Plans
・Add a word and sentence count feature\
・Change text color every n characters\
・Add a sharing button\
・Get some feedback\
  etc.
